This project was made possible through https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Piano

This is the first random project I worked on to practice getting more coding experience. 

I learned that VSCODE makes things a lot easier with intellisense, but I am unsure if I should be relying on it too often. This project was completed without using it too often.

I also learned how to use a bit more of Git on here to track my project and put it on GitHub.
